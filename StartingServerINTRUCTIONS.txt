It is pretty simple to set up your own locally hosted site:

1. You need to make sure you have the pathway to the directory on your local computer.
To find this you need click File->Open Folder then copy the pathway of the folder
Ex. C:\Users\""USER""\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\COSC310-Team-2

2. Open command prompt or terminal
3. Type : cd GITHUB-FOLDER-pathway
4. cd BackEnd
5. npm run dev

6. Open a new command prompt or terminal
7. Type : cd GITHUB-FOLDER-pathway
9. cd FrontEnd
8. npm run dev

***YOU SHOULD NOT GET ANY ERRORS FROM THE ABOVE COMMANDS :)******

9. Now open your browser and go to http://localhost:5173
10.BOOM
